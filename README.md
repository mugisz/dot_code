## Libraries/utilites:

**General:**

- `react-router-dom` Used for handling routing. I think this is a best choice for react routing nowadays.

- `vitest` Used for implementing unit-tests.

**Task 1. Interactive desktop:**

- `react-grid-layout:` Used for creating an interactive desktop layout. It helps manage grid-based positioning, movement, and resizing of blocks effectively, easily and customizable.

**Task 2. Websocket connection:**

- `Default WebSocket:` Utilized to subscribe to transactions through the Blockchain WebSocket API. I think, for this task pure WebSocket is the optimal solution. While socket.io may be more suitable for more complex requirements or when working with custom servers, the default WebSocket offers a simpler, more appropriate approach here.
